                <h2>NEVER FORGET WHO YOU ARE</h2>
                <h3>I know you have dreams and those dreams defined you.
                <br>
                    Last September, you decided to say good bye to your passion.
                    <br>
                    The thing you've been working on for 5 years.
                    <br>
                    It's been a part of your life, rather, it was your life. 
                    <br>
                    It made you regret your choices. Small choices that led to big consequences.
                    <br>
                    You woke up everyday wishing you could turn back time and do things differently. 
                    <br>
                    You felt empty and unhappy especially when you're alone.
                    <br>
                    When you quit your passion, it was the time when you lost sight of your dreams. 
                    <br>
                    And that was also the time when you lost yourself.
                    <br>
                    Things didn't turn out as you hoped and you were disappointed of yourself.. 
                    <br>
                    But this just means that God has appointed you to do something better.
                    <br>
                    You'll get there. It may be the same destination or it may change.
                    <br>
                    But you'll get there.
                    <br>
                    And you will be happy
                    <br>
                    Remember, "you are the most talented, most interesting, and most extraordinary person in the universe. And you are capable of amazing things. Because you are the Special. And so am I. And so is everyone. The prophecy is made up, but it's also true. It's about all of us. Right now, it's about you, and you....still.....can change everything." 
                    <br>
                    You. Are. Ylesa. Erliria. Puente.

                        <h3>I know you have dreams and now you have finally achieved it. By now, you probably gave your parents a splendid silver wedding and a vacation that they deserve for everything that they did for you (though it can never be repayed). You've graduated in BS Inudstrial Engineering with a latin honor and finally crowned as MVP in the UAAP. You'll now join Bb. Pilipinas to get another crown and represent Philippines around the world. Your advocacy will be motivating children to study so that they may have a frutful life. After winning the crown for the Philippines, you'll be establishing your own charity organization for the kids and for everyone you wish to help. You have a bucket list written in your notebook that includes sky diving, cliff jumping and all that sorts of stuff. Just do that. Go marry and spread some genes. Thank God everytime because it's all from him and it's all for him.</h3>
